# Homework 6: "Undone (The Sweater Container)" 
### Scenario: The API you developed for the ISS positional and velocity data (in homework 04) is a great start! But, there are many improvements we could make in order to make the API more useful. And, we can use some smart software engineering & design strategies to make our app more portable.
#### Objective: Gain familiarity with flask and containers. 

### Data:
The data for this homework set is a XML file that contains information on the state Vectors of the ISS at different epochs (points in time). The data can be viewed here: [ISS Public Data](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/trajectory_data.cfm).

The Data is read in as XML and converted to a python dictionary with the module `xmltodict`

### Scripts:

`iss_tracker.py`:
Flask application for querying the ISS position and velocity. The application should loads in the data mentioned above and provides flask routes for a user to digest the data and find specific data points and values associated with specific data points.
The routes and returns are as follows


| Route         | Return        | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| `/`     | returns full data set | 
| `/epochs`       | returns all epochs in the data set      |
| `/epochs/<int:epoch>`  | returns all the data (state vectors) associated with a specific epoch      |
| `/epochs/<int:epoch>/position`  | returns the positional coordinates of a specific epoch     |
| `/epochs/<int:epoch>/velocity`  | returns the velocity of a specific epoch        |
| `/epochs/<int:epoch>/speed`  | returns the speed of a specific epoch      |
| `/help`  | Return help text (as a string) that briefly describes each route     |
| `/delete-data`  | Delete all data from the dictionary object |
| `/post-data`  | Reload the dictionary object with data from the web |


** Note: epoch takes in an integer value, corresponding to the index of the epoch (i.e. the first epoch in the data set is epoch = 1)




`Dockerfile`: Text document that contains the commands to assemble the iss_tracker Docker image that is used to produce the Docker container when ran. 

### Instructions and Installation:
#### Method 1: Use Existing Docker Image:

To use the existing Docker Image run the following commands:
```
$ docker pull jthet/iss_tracker:hw05
...
$ docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 jthet/iss_tracker:hw05
```
This will open the flask app. Skip to step 2 of method 2 below to see how to use the flask app. 

#### Method 2: Build a new image from Dockerfile:
To build a new image from the existing Dockerfile, execute the following commands:
Note: Dockerfile must be in the current directory when this command is executed.
```
$ docker build -t <dockerhubusername>/<code>:<version> .
```
Example:
```
$ docker build -t jthet/iss_tracker:hw05 .

```

Check the image was built with `$ docker images`:
```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                 TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
jthet/iss_tracker        1.0        2883079fad18   About a minute ago   928MB

```
Run the image with the following:
```
$ docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 jthet/iss_tracker:hw05
```
This will open the flask app in a new container.

### Running the Flask App

#### After the container is built and the Flask app is running:
This should output the following prompt:

```
$ docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 jthet/iss_tracker:hw05
 * Serving Flask app 'iss_tracker'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.

```

#### Using the Flask app
Each route can be accesd with the following:
```
$ curl localhost:5000/ [ROUTE]
```


All of the routes and example output are shown below.

HERE IS A HELP MESSAGE FOR EVERY FUNCTION/ROUTE IN "iss_tracker.py"

get_data:

    Retrieves the data from the nasa published ISS location coordinates, converts from XML to a dictionary, and returns the 
    Valuable data concering the ISS position and velocity at different times. 

    Route: None, only used to retreive data for other routes

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        data (dict): the ISS stateVectors at different epochs
    

get_all:

    Returns all epochs for the entire data set of the ISS state vectors. Decorated with the app route "<baseURL>/"

    Route: <baseURL>/

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        dataSet (dict): Dictionary of all epochs and corresponding state Vectors of the ISS
    
```

Route: `/delete-data` (Must use `-X DELETE` tag)
```
$ curl -X DELETE localhost:5000/delete-data
Data is deleted
```

Route: `/post-data` (Must use `-X POST` tag)
```
$ curl -X POST localhost:5000/post-data
Data is posted
```


### Query Parameters
The route `/epochs` has 2 query paramaters: "limit" and "offset" 

The offset query parameter should offset the start point by an integer. For example, `offset=0` would begin printing at the first Epoch, `offset=1` would begin printing at the second Epoch, etc. The limit query parameter controls how many results are returned. For example `limit=10` would return 10 Epochs, `limit=100` would return 100 Epochs, etc. Putting them together, the route `/epochs?limit=20&offset=50` would return Epochs 51 through 70 (20 total).

Example:
```
$ curl 'localhost:5000/epochs?limit=4&offset=20'
{
  "21": "2023-055T13:20:00.000Z",
  "22": "2023-055T13:24:00.000Z",
  "23": "2023-055T13:28:00.000Z",
  "24": "2023-055T13:32:00.000Z"
}
```
